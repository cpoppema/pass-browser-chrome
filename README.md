# pass-browser-chrome

pass-browser-chrome is a browser plugin for chrome/chromium that brings your secrets managed by `pass` to your browser. Read all about `pass` [here](http://www.passwordstore.org).

## How to use

If you have not installed a compatible server yet, you can just install one:

* [node-server](https://github.com/cpoppema/pass-server-node#installation) for a server written in JavaScript

For this setup to work, secrets must be stored in the format `url/username`, for example: `github.com/cpoppema`. You can still categorize secrets since the server assumes the filename is the username and the directory the secrets exists in is the url. Multiline secrets are no issue either since the browser plugin only recognized the first line of your secret as the password.

## How to install

Install the browser plugin by either:
- adding it from the [web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pass-browser-chrome/ncoadlppaciemlepmdmdnecjlfmbidcd) (this shows some screenshots also)
- downloading pass-browser-chrome-{version}.crx directly from the [releases](../../releases) page
- building it yourself
    * clone this repository
    * run `npm install`
    * run `grunt`
    * install the extension from file build/pass-browser-chrome-{version}.crx

## How to give this extension access to your passwords

Since your secrets are decrypted directly in your browser, you will need to generate a keypair and import the public key on your server, this is easy.

After installing this browser plugin, open the plugin and go to Options. There you'll find a form that helps you create a keypair and save it in your browser. To import the public key, simply connect with your server and run these commands.

The only things required are that you already have `gpg` and `pass` installed.

Replace this sample key with the key that you just generated in the plugin options.

Run:
```Shell
echo "-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----

-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----" | gpg --import -
```

You will see something like this, all you need to remember is one thing from this output: the key ID. The ID here is `5AF8663E`. You can also use the longer key ID you can find in the plugin options. In this example it would be A6A041765AF8663E.

```Shell
gpg: /home/me/.gnupg/trustdb.gpg: trustdb created
gpg: key 5AF8663E: public key "pass-extension-chrome" imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1  (RSA: 1)
```

All that is left is to:

* sign your imported key
* tell `pass` to allow this key to access your secrets

**Sign your imported key**

To tell `gpg` you trust this source you're required to sign this key before it is of any use.

Run
```Shell
gpg --sign-key 5AF8663E
```

Signing requires an existing trusted key on your server. A trusted key is also required for `pass` to add new secrets.

**Tell pass to allow this key**

All that is left is to tell `pass` to encrypt your secrets using this public key so the browser plugin can decrypt it on your computer.

```Shell
pass init {KEY ID 1} {KEY ID 2}
```

So let's say your existing trusted key's ID is AF3D26E5, run
```Shell
pass init AF3D26E5 5AF8663E
```

The output might look something like this if you've only setup `pass` just now:

```Shell
mkdir: created directory ‘/home/me/.password-store/’
Password store initialized for AF3D26E5, 5AF8663E
```

Or if you already had a password store, it probably looks more like this:

```Shell
Password store initialized for AF3D26E5, 5AF8663E
github.com/cpoppema: reencrypting to 088BAD9F22BD2048 15EF6677CC78CF01
```

**One-Time-Passwords/2FA/Two-Factor-Authentication**

This plugin also supports generating tokens for your 2FA logins. To set this up. You can use this [pass plugin](https://github.com/tadfisher/pass-otp). Note that you're required to run pass >= 1.7.0 for the plugin to work.
Once installed, the plugin can link two secrets together that have similar usernames, one that is your actual username and one special username with an `-otp` suffix.

```
 $    tree ~/.password-store | sed 's/├/\+/g; s/─/-/g; s/└/\\/g'
/home/cornelis/.password-store
+-- github.com
    +-- rcaldwell.gpg
    \-- rcaldwell-otp.gpg
```

The plugin will show new buttons beside an indicator `2FA` for supported secrets to either `Fill`, `Copy` or `Show` the token. *Note*: only "Only Time-based One Time Passwords" (TOTP) are possible at this time, "HMAC-based One Time Password" (HOTP) are _not_ supported.
